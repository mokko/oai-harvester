This is a very simple OAI harverster written in perl, based on Tim Brody's
great HTTP::OAI. It comes with a few other small and simple perl scripts
which I use to deal with my oai/xml workflow.

HARVESTER

Parameters go into a conf file which is written in yaml format.

I think it is likely that you will want to do the same harvesting processes
several times. So i think it is good to store that data in one conf file so you
execute that again.

In the following examples I assume you want to write output to files in a xml
directory. Make sure that you create it!

#conf/m61117mpx.yml
baseURL: 'http://spk.mimo-project.eu:8080/oai'
verb: 'GetRecord'
metadataPrefix: 'lido'
identifier: 'spk-berlin.de:EM-objId-61117'
output: 'xml/61117.lido.xml'
unwrap: 'true'

#in shell
>bin/harvester.pl -d conf/m1234.yml
